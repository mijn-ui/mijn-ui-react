import {
  ResizableHandle,
  ResizablePanel,
  ResizablePanelGroup,
} from "@/app/components/resizable"
import { BlockViewer } from "@/app/components/block-viewer"
import Link from "next/link"

By default, Mijn-UI components don't provide responsive variants out of the box because there aren't many cases where you need them. Additionally, you can easily make components responsive by adding Tailwind CSS class names.

This guide will show you how to create responsive variants for your components.

There are two main ways to create responsive variants:

1. [Using `tailwind-variants` built-in responsive variants.](#making-components-responsive-using-tailwind-variants)
2. [Using the `use-responsive-variants` hook.](#making-component-responsive-using-use-responsive-variants-hook)

## Making Components Responsive Using `tailwind-variants`

<Alert color="info" className="mt-8">
  Although you can use [tailwind-variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/docs/getting-started#responsive-variants-optional) to make components responsive, it has a limitation when it comes to making compound variants responsive. To overcome this limitation, you can use the [use-responsive-variants](#making-component-responsive-using-use-responsive-variants-hook) hook.
</Alert>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install necessary dependencies

    ```package-install
    tailwind-variants
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Configure Tailwind CSS

    To make responsive variants work smoothly, you need to wrap the Tailwind config with the `withTV` function from `tailwind-variants`. You can refer to the [tailwind-variants documentation](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/docs/getting-started#responsive-variants-optional) for more details.

    ```ts title="tailwind.config.ts"
    import { mijnui } from "@mijn-ui/react-theme";
    import { withTV } from "tailwind-variants/dist/transformer.js"; // [!code highlight]

    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
    export default withTV({ // [!code highlight]
      content: [
        // ...
        // make sure it's pointing to the ROOT node_module
        "./node_modules/@mijn-ui/react-theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
      ],
      plugins: [mijnui({})],
    }); // [!code highlight]
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Applying Responsive Variants to Component

    You can apply the responsive variants to the component like this:

    ```json doc-gen:file
    {
      "file": "./blocks/components/responsive-button/button-with-tv.tsx",
      "codeblock": {
        "lang": "tsx",
        "meta": "title=\"components/button-with-tv.tsx\""
      }
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Using the Component

    ```tsx
    import ResponsiveButton from "@/components/responsive-button";

    const App = () => {
      return (
        <ResponsiveButton size={{initial: "icon", sm: "md", lg: "lg"}}>Button</ResponsiveButton>
      )
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<BlockViewer name="tv-responsive-button" />

## Making Component Responsive Using `use-responsive-variants` Hook

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### Add the following hook file to your project:

    ```json doc-gen:file
    {
      "file": "./blocks/components/responsive-button/use-responsive-variants.ts",
      "codeblock": {
        "lang": "tsx",
        "meta": "title=\"hooks/use-responsive-variants.ts\""
      }
    }
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Use the Hook in Your Component

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./blocks/components/responsive-button/button-with-hook.tsx",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "tsx",
    "meta": "title=\"components/button-with-hook.tsx\""
  }
}
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<BlockViewer name="hook-responsive-button" />

By following this guide, you can easily create responsive variants for Mijn-UI components using either `tailwind-variants` or the `use-responsive-variants` hook. Each approach provides flexibility and ensures your components look great on any screen size.
