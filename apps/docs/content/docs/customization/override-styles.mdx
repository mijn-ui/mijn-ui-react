title: Override Styles
description: Overriding default component styles is as simple as passing your own class names to the `className` or to the `classNames` prop for components with slots.

### What is a Slot?

A slot is a part of a component that can be styled separately. For example, the Accordion component has multiple slots/parts that can be styled individually, such as `base`, `item`, `triggerWrapper`, `trigger`, etc.

Components with slots have a `classNames` prop that allows you to style each slot separately.

### Overriding a Component

Let's override the default styles of the [Badge](/docs/components/badge) component, which has only one `base` slot.

<ComponentPreview>
  <BadgeOverride />
</ComponentPreview>

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./examples/badge/badge-override.tsx",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "tsx",
    "meta": "title=\"\""
  }
}
```

### Components with Slots

All components have slots that can be styled separately.
<Alert color="info" title="Note:">
For components like `label` and `badge` that only have one slot, you cannot use the `classNames` prop to style the slots. Instead, you can pass the `className` prop to customize the style of the component. An example of this has already been shown above.
</Alert>

For components with multiple slots, you can pass the `classNames` prop to style each slot separately. For example, the [Accordion](/docs/components/accordion) component has the following slots:

- **base:** The main container of the accordion.
- **item:** Each individual item within the accordion.
- **triggerWrapper:** The wrapper around the trigger element.
- **trigger:** The element that triggers the accordion to open or close.
- **icon:** The icon displayed within the trigger.
- **contentWrapper:** The wrapper around the content.
- **content:** The content displayed when the accordion is open.

Each slot can be styled using the `classNames` prop. The example below shows how to change the styles of some slots to create an Accordion component with a different style.

  <AccordionCustomStyles />

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./examples/accordion/custom-styles-accordion.tsx",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "tsx",
    "meta": "title=\"\""
  }
}
```
