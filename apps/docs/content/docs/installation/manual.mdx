    ✔ Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
    ✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes # [!code highlight]
    ✔ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes

    ✔ Would you like to use Turbopack for next dev? No / Yes
    ✔ Would you like to customize the import alias (@/* by default)? No / Yes
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Install Dependencies

  Install the required packages:

  ```package-install
  @mijn-ui/react-core @mijn-ui/react-theme @mijn-ui/react-utilities @mijn-ui/react-hooks @mijn-ui/shared-icons tailwindcss-animate 
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Tailwind CSS Configuration

  Configure Tailwind CSS by updating your `tailwind.config.ts` file:

  ```ts title="tailwind.config.ts"
  import { mijnui } from "@mijn-ui/react-theme" // [!code highlight]
  import animationPlugin from "tailwindcss-animate" // [!code highlight]

  /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
  export default {
    content: [
      // ...
      // make sure it's pointing to the ROOT node_module
      "./node_modules/@mijn-ui/react-theme/dist/**/*.js", // [!code highlight]
    ],
    darkMode: "class", // [!code highlight]
    plugins: [animationPlugin, mijnui({})], // [!code highlight]
  }
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Add Tailwind CSS to Your Global Styles

  Make sure your global CSS file includes the following Tailwind CSS directives:

  ```css title="global.css"
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### That's it

  You can now start adding components to your project. Check out the [components](/docs/components/accordion) section to learn more about the available components.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Note:

When using Mijn-UI components manually, you will need to resolve the import paths in your project. This is because all of the code is directly from the package source files.

For example, update your imports like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@mijn-ui/react-utilities"; // [!code --]
import { Button } from "@/components/button"; // [!code ++]
```

## Why Choose Manual Integration?

Manual integration might be the right choice if you need more control or are concerned about the stability of the npm packages.

### 1. **Access to Source Code**

- Full control over the components for deeper customization or understanding.

### 2. **Avoid NPM Package Instability**

- If you’re concerned about potential breaking changes in the npm packages, manual integration can be a more stable approach.

### 3. **Customizable Foundations**

- Modify and extend components directly to suit your needs.

For example, here’s how you can extend the [Button](/docs/components/button) variants by manually integrating MijnUI components:

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./examples/button/button-extend.tsx",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "tsx",
    "meta": "title=\"components/button.tsx\""
  }
}
```

**Usage**

```tsx
<Button color="olive">Extended Button</Button>
```

<ComponentPreview className="min-h-28">
  <Button color="olive">Extended Button</Button>
</ComponentPreview>
