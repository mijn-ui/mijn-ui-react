  ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
  #### Tailwind CSS Configuration

  Configure Tailwind CSS by updating your `tailwind.config.ts` file:

  ```ts title="tailwind.config.ts"
  import { mijnUiPreset } from "@mijn-ui/react-theme" // [!code highlight]

  /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
  export default {
    content: [
      // ...
      // make sure it's pointing to the ROOT node_module
      "./node_modules/@mijn-ui/react-theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", // [!code highlight]
    ],
    presets: [mijnUiPreset], // [!code highlight]
  };
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
  #### Add Tailwind CSS to Your Global Styles

  Make sure your global CSS file includes the following Tailwind CSS directives:

  ```css title="global.css"
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
  #### That's it

  You can now start adding components to your project. Check out the [components](/docs/components/accordion) section to learn more about the available components.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Manual Installation

If you want to use Mijn-UI components manually, make sure to finish the [installation guide](#installation-guide) setup and then install the additional dependencies:


```package-install
@mijn-ui/react-utilities @mijn-ui/react-hooks @mijn-ui/shared-icons
```

When using Mijn-UI components manually, you will need to resolve the import paths in your project. This is because all of the code is directly from the package source files.

For example, update your imports like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@mijn-ui/react-utilities"; // [!code --]
import { Button } from "@/components/button"; // [!code ++]
```
