MijnUI is a React component library designed to help you create a customized, robust design system with minimal effort.

> Ever notice how, when a library becomes popular, all the apps start to look the same

### Motivation: The Issue with Similar-Looking Apps

React component libraries have evolved over time, each solving some challenges while introducing others:

- **Material UI and Similar Libraries**: These libraries accelerated development by bundling styles with components, but their predefined aesthetics were difficult to customize. This led to many applications sharing a uniform "Material Design" look, making it hard to achieve a unique appearance.
    
- **Headless Libraries**: Headless libraries, such as Radix UI, provide unstyled components, giving developers full control over styling. However, this freedom often comes at the cost of time and effort spent on building and maintaining a cohesive design system from scratch.
    
- **Copy-Paste Trends**: Libraries like shadcn/ui offered a solid foundation with headless components and preconfigured styles. Despite this, the ease of use resulted in many apps adopting similar “minimalist” aesthetics, even when some customization was applied.

### How MijnUI Solves These Issues

MijnUI addresses these challenges with features that make it flexible and easy to use:

- **More Design Options**: Additional variants help integrate components seamlessly into your design system.
- **Flexible Integration**: Choose between using MijnUI as an npm package or integrating components manually for full customization.
- **Styled and Unstyled Modes**: While libraries like shadcn/ui require extra steps to override styles, MijnUI simplifies this process. Components like `DialogContent`, which often depend on complex logic, can switch to an unstyled mode by passing an `unstyled` prop. This saves time and effort while preserving the component’s functionality.
